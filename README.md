# cypher

This is my basic encryptor that replaces the letter with a symbol.
Like the font you can use in text editors.


Only the dictionary's are required to run cipher,
the other code I used to create cipher but are not required.

Recipher is the code that i edit before putting in to cipher and will often have bugs
so it is advised not to use.
